"""Command palette — every meaningful action, searchable by name.

Textual ships a fuzzy command palette (ctrl+p); the app binds so many bare
single letters that memorising them all is a chore, so we surface the whole
verb list here. Each entry runs an existing ``action_*`` (via ``run_action``,
so args are the same Python-literal strings the bindings use). Registered
alongside — never instead of — Textual's built-in system commands.

Labels stay lowercase to match the app's aesthetic; icons are ``\\uXXXX``
escapes only (nerd-font FontAwesome, mirroring ricekit.icons). The command
list is a module constant but the hits are built per-search, so the palette
always reflects the app's real verbs.
