"""Album-art-derived live theming — tint the chrome with the cover's color.

When the current song's art loads we pull one vibrant color out of it and
nudge accent roles (`blue`/`lav`/`mauve`) toward it, so borders, the
progress bar, sidebar icons and text quietly take on the album's hue.
The tint is a thin layer over `ricekit.palette`: roles are still read at
render time, so a theme switch (which rebuilds the palette) wins — the app
just re-applies whatever tint is active afterwards.

Everything degrades off:

- no truecolor (`system`/ANSI theme) → `anim.can_blend()` is False, so we
  never touch the palette and the terminal's own colors stay untouched
- no art / extraction failure → the tint clears and the theme is untinted
- Pillow missing → extraction returns None; the feature is simply inert

Extraction runs off the already-cached local art file and is cheap (a
32px thumbnail), but callers still keep it off the UI's critical path.
